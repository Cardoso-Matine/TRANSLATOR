# TRANSLATOR 🌍↔️🌎
A web translator developed in Django that uses the MyMemory API for translations in 10 languages.

👉 Live Demo: https://translatorweb.pythonanywhere.com

## Technologies used
- Backend: Python + Django
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- API: MyMemory Translation API
- Deploy: PythonAnywhere
- Dependencies:
 - requests (API consumption)
 - whitenoise (serving static files)
 - gunicorn (WSGI server for production)

## What I Learned Building This Project:

Developing TRANSLATOR was an amazing challenge! I gained hands-on experience with:

- Integrating external APIs (MyMemory) with Django

- Handling async requests in the frontend

- Structuring a full-stack project (backend to deployment)

- Solving real-world issues like CORS and error handling

Seeing the translator work after countless tests was  magical! It showed me how small lines of code can break big language barriers.
